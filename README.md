#Working Name - Delta
This is a project in its infancy, but one I am very excited about. This will be an asynchronous Message Queue processor, using twisted and pika.
When it reaches its more advanced stages, it will provide an easily customizable language for multiple servers to speak to one another.
#What will it be good for
  * Built in centralized logging for distributed network of servers
    * Easy for logging to transfer to other networks, eg. Slack, Email...
  * One server can easily alert another when a task needs to be done
  * Will make scalability and efficient use of processing power very obtainable
